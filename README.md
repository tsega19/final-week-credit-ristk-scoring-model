# Credit Risk Scoring Model

## Overview
This project develops a credit scoring model for Bati Bank's buy-now-pay-later service in partnership with an eCommerce company. The model aims to assess customer creditworthiness and predict the likelihood of default.

## Business Context
Bati Bank, a leading financial service provider, is partnering with an eCommerce company to offer a buy-now-pay-later service. This project creates a Credit Scoring Model using data provided by the eCommerce platform to evaluate potential borrowers.
